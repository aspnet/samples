ASP.NET Web API Basic Authentication Sample
-----------------------------------
This sample demonstrates a custom authentication filter with Web API. It uses
the HTTP Basic Access Authentication scheme defined by RFC 2617 combined with
the ASP.NET Identity system for storing user names, passwords, roles and claims.

The sample automatically populates the Identity database with a sample user.

To run the sample, first start the server; then run the client and press ENTER.
